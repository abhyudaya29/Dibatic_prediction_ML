Diabetes Predictor
Predict Diabetes using Machine Learning.

The goal of this project is to build a machine-learning model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on several features such as Glucose level, Insulin, Age, and BMI. We will go through all the steps from data gathering to model deployment. During model evaluation, we will compare different machine learning algorithms based on the accuracy_score metric to find the best-performing one. Finally, we will create a web application using Flask, a Python microframework, to provide an interface for users to make predictions.

The Overview of the Dataset

## Here the outcome features unique values that are 1 and 0
## Here 1 Means the PAtient has Diabetes and 0 means the patient has no Diabetes

34% are Dibati Patienst and rest are non dibatic
