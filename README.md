Diabetes Predictor
Predict Diabetes using Machine Learning.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on several features such as Glucose level, Insulin, Age, and BMI. We will go through all the steps from data gathering to model deployment. During model evaluation, we will compare different machine learning algorithms based on the accuracy_score metric to find the best-performing one. Finally, we will create a web application using Flask, a Python microframework, to provide an interface for users to make predictions.
